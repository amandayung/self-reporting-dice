# Self-Reporting Dice

This was a final project for the HCI class "Designing UX for Internet-Enabled Devices" (HCIN-720) at the Rochester Institute of Technology. We developed a pair of dice where one sends its roll results via the cloud, and the other physically rolls itself to match the paired die. We envision these dice can be used for playing tabletop games remotely with other players.
